***LICENCE INFORMATION***

While you use one of my fonts, there are a few things you can do to make the world a better place :

You want to design your company logo, create clothes, make a cd cover, stickers, club flyer or ANYTHING that might bring you some ca$h ? Then it's a commercial use. If you want to make money - I completely respect that, trust me - and you think one of my fonts can be part of that, I would be delighted to allow you to use one of my fonts for a commercial purpose. All you have to do is contact me (contact@fthafm.com), and then we'll talk about a donation. I'm not going to rob you, you can give 5, 10, 20$/€, maybe even more if you're in a really good mood. If you're a graphic designer, you should definitely include this in the client's budget. Then I'll provide a legal document saying you have the right to use one of my fonts for a commercial purpose.

Nobody likes to see their work being stolen or improperly used. I'm glad if you agree we should respect that. Good work deserves recognition. Trying to use a font for free to avoid paying a small donation won't make you a better person, and you might go in hell for that - I've heard rumors.

You want to design a flyer for your school party, a birthday card for your mother, print a t-shirt you'll be the only one to wear ? And won't make any money - even by selling cookies at your school party (just kidding) ? Then it's personal use. You're free to use these fonts free of charge, as long as you don't make any profit with it. If you're happy you found a font you like, and are really glad about using it, you can still send me an email to tell me about it, and show me what you've done - it's always nice to talk about that and see what people are doing with it. 

You like one of my fonts but think a few changes should be done before using it ? If you want to import characters from one of my fonts as graphical objects into a drawing program and modify such graphical objects, you're free to do it. That still makes it a commercial use, if you want to make money, you won't have the excuse that you "changed" a few characters, it doesn't work. You may not modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on the licensed font itself without the author’s prior written consent - and that's me (contact@fthafm.com). But if you really see something you absolutely want to change and make it a corporate typeface, please, feel free to contact me before doing it, I won't bite, I promise. We can always work something out, and I'm a pretty cool guy in the end, I always reply to emails - in case I'm in the middle of nowhere on a train as I do from time to time, you'll have to forgive me about the delay, but I usually reply within 24 or 48 hours. 

One special character is missing and you absolutely need it ? You can also contact me, as you may not be the only one needing this special character, I might be able to help you with this issue.

Long story short, this font is free for personal use only.

If you have any other question, feel absolutely free to contact me : contact@fthafm.com.

If you want to consider a donation through Paypal, please use this email address : contact@fthafm.com
